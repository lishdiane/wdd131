                <p>
                    My name is Diane, I'm 34, and I live in Idaho. I am a mom to 4 kids and many animals, including a
                    dog, a cat, a parrot, a frog, and 3 chickens. I strive in the chaos of a house full of life and
                    love. If I have any free time beyond home life and school life, I enjoy spending it outdoors. Since
                    my kids are still young, most of our outdoor time involves exploring and getting messy! I also enjoy
                    anything that involves art, like cake decorating ( I can make some pretty cool-looking cakes),
                    making awesome Halloween costumes, and planning fun parties for the kids. I'm working toward a
                    Bachelor's in Software Development. Who knew that would be something I enjoy doing!? Not me! It has
                    been a fun and rewarding challenge that I love. I'm not entirely sure where this new education
                    adventure will take me but I am excited to see where I go.

                    Beautiful mountains and stunning landscapes are just some of the reasons to love Idaho. The state
                    capitol, Boise, is located in southwest Idaho and is surrounded by 4.7 million acres of forest. With
                    over 100 mountain ranges and more than 3,000 miles of rivers, Idaho has endless adventures for the
                    outdoor enthusiast. If food is the way to your heart, Idaho is famous for its potatos,
                    huckleberries, morel mushrooms, wine, and much more. Whatever your interests Idaho is sure to be
                    able to meet them.
